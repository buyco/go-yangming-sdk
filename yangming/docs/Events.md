and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewEventsWithDefaults

`func NewEventsWithDefaults() *Events`

This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetEvents

`func (o *Events) GetEvents() []Event`

GetEvents returns the Events field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetEventsOk

GetEventsOk returns a tuple with the Events field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.
